# StopBedrockPlacing
A simple spigot plugin that stops bedrock players from being able to place blocks in-front of them while running - stopping them from having an advantage over java players.

This plugin does not require GeyserMc to start, but it's useless without it.

## Installation
Just put the .jar in your plugins folder
